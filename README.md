#<b>CoffeeMachine Java Program</b>
<br>
     <br> I worked on programming a coffee-machine simulator. The machine works with quite typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. The machine can make three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money.
